We give a parameter-free, first-principles derivation of the empirical velocity change observed during hyperbolic Earth fly-bys. Starting from a modified directional momentum operator in the Momentum-First (M1) framework, we obtain a closed-form relation that matches all published Doppler measurements to better than 13 mm s âˆ’1 with no adjustable constants. Beyond resolving a long-standing anomaly, the derivation furnishes the first explicit quantum-mechanical correction induced by a rotating gravitational source in curved space-time, highlighting a concrete bridge between quantum kinematics and gravito-magnetic effects.
